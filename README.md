#README

This repo contains the config files I use in my Linux distribs

## Explanation

### Gitconfig
I added a way to switch user infos depending on where is located the git module
By default, git.config is used from the main `.gitconfig` file.
If I'm in my personal sub directories (currently `~/perso/`), it use gitconfig-perso
I created also a github specific config.
This changes automatically the author when I commit.

## Next
- [ ] Need to add a `install` script
